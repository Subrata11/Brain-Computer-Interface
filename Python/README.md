# Process signal waves brain with Python

There are open sources of Python allow us analytics waves signal:

+ [MNE-Python](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html): Help us explore, visualize, and analyze human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more.
+ [Nipy](http://nipy.org/): A community of practice devoted to the use of the Python programming language in the analysis of neuroimaging data.
+ [PyEEG](http://pyeeg.sourceforge.net/): Python + EEG/MEG = PyEEG

Otherwise, we have referenced additional as [CbuMeg (CBU Magnetoencephalography)](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/meg/CbuMeg), [Research Projects of Brainwaves for Science](http://brainwaves.colostate.edu/research.aspx)
